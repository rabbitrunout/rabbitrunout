## 🚀 About Me

I build modern mobile and web applications with a focus on:

- Clean architecture
- Structured data modeling
- Scalable feature-based organization
- Clear separation of UI and business logic

My primary focus is **iOS development using SwiftUI and Core Data**,  
while maintaining strong full-stack fundamentals including React, REST APIs, and relational database systems.

I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from UI design and state management to API integration and data persistence.
