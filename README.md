## 🚀 About Me

I build mobile and web applications with a focus on clean UI, scalable architecture, and structured data flow.  

My primary focus is iOS development using SwiftUI and Core Data, while maintaining strong full-stack fundamentals including React, REST APIs, and SQL-based backend systems.

I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from UI design and state management to API integration and data modeling.
